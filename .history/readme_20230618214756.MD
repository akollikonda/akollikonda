### Hi there 👋, My name is Abhilash Kollikonda
#### I am an Data Engineer
#### I am an ML Engineer
#### I am an Backend developer 

👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate data engineer with 6 years of experience in building robust and scalable data solutions. My expertise lies in SQL, Python, GCP, AWS, DBT, Snowflake, APIs, and ML models, along with proficiency in backend development using Django. I currently work as a Senior Data Engineer in a finance corporation.

💡 Throughout my career, I have successfully designed and implemented complex data pipelines, utilizing my strong SQL skills to extract, transform, and load data from various sources. I'm well-versed in Python, enabling me to write efficient ETL scripts, automate workflows, and perform data analysis tasks.

🌐 As a data engineer, I have hands-on experience working with cloud platforms such as GCP and AWS. I'm adept at leveraging the power of these platforms to build scalable data architectures, deploy data pipelines, and manage big data processing using services like BigQuery, Redshift, and S3.

🔧 I have a deep understanding of DBT (Data Build Tool), which I utilize to define, document, and test data transformations, ensuring the reliability and quality of data. I'm proficient in working with Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform, allowing me to design and optimize data models for analytical purposes.

🚀 Additionally, I possess strong API integration skills, enabling seamless data exchange between systems and building data-driven applications. I'm well-versed in implementing RESTful APIs and proficient in integrating third-party APIs to enrich and enhance data capabilities.

🤖 With a keen interest in machine learning, I have developed expertise in building ML models for predictive analytics and data-driven decision-making. I have experience in feature engineering, model development, and evaluation, using frameworks such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

💻 Moreover, I'm skilled in backend development using Django, an efficient Python web framework. I have leveraged Django's capabilities to build robust and scalable web applications, incorporating data processing, APIs, and user authentication.

📚 Continuous learning is a crucial part of my professional journey, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the data engineering domain.
